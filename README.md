<h2 align="center">Hello there! I'm Yuna Zhao. 👋🤓</h2>
<p align="center">I'm currently a student pursuing my Bachelor of Network Project. I'm passionate about block chain and cyber security.  I've started exploring the field of web 3.0 as well ✨ and hope to contribute to that field as well. 
</p>

<p align="center">When I'm not developing and coding, you can find me watching Netflix, playing piano or listening to music. Playing football :soccer: was also on that list, but quarantine has removed that for now 😢. Memes are something that are appreciated very much 😂. </p>
